# Kiosk Usage Tutorial

This tutorial guides both customers and store owners on how to use the Kiosk feature.

## Customer Tutorial: Ordering Through the Kiosk

Follow these steps to easily place your order using our kiosk system.

### 1. Accessing the Kiosk

You can access a store's kiosk in two ways:

**Method A: In-App/Website Navigation**
*   Start by browsing stores or categories within our app or on our website.
*   Select the store you wish to order from.
*   On the store's page, look for and tap the **"키오스크 페이지로 이동"** (Go to Kiosk Page) button.

**Method B: Scanning a QR Code**
*   Locate the QR code displayed at the store (provided by the store owner).
*   Use your smartphone's camera or a QR scanning app to scan the code. This will take you directly to the store's kiosk page.

### 2. Welcome to the Kiosk & Product Browsing
*   The kiosk interface will load, displaying the store's name and a welcome message. You might also see a session or device number.
*   Browse through product categories (e.g., "Drinks," "Snacks") or scroll through the full product list.

### 3. Selecting and Customizing Your Product
*   Tap on a product to see more details or to start customizing it.
*   If the product has options (like size, toppings, etc.), a selection window will appear.
*   Make your choices. The price will update as you select options.
*   Confirm your selections to add the item to your cart. For products without options, tapping "Add to Cart" adds it directly.

### 4. Reviewing and Modifying Your Cart
*   An icon (usually at the top or bottom of the screen) shows the number of items in your cart and the running total.
*   Tap this cart icon to open a summary of your order.
*   Here, you can review all items, change quantities, or remove items from your order.

### 5. Proceeding to Checkout & Policy Review
*   Once you're happy with your order, tap the "Checkout," "Place Order," or similar button.
*   **Important:** Before you complete your purchase, the system will display all relevant purchasing policies (Terms of Service, Privacy Policy, etc.). Please review these carefully and acknowledge them to proceed.

## Store Owner Tutorial: Managing Your Kiosk

This guide helps you set up and manage your store's kiosk effectively.

### 1. Accessing Kiosk Management
*   Log in to your SanggaTalk merchant dashboard.
*   Navigate to your store's settings and find the "Kiosk Management," "Edit Kiosk Display," or a similarly named section.
*   **Note:** Your store's unique Kiosk QR code is provided by us (SanggaTalk). Please print this QR code and display it prominently for your customers to scan for easy kiosk access.

    `[Image: Store Owner - Step 1 - Screenshot of the merchant dashboard highlighting the Kiosk Management section]`

### 2. Kiosk Configuration Dashboard
*   This is your main control panel for the kiosk. You'll find sections for:
    *   **Menu Builder/Editor:** Design what customers see.
    *   **Order Dashboard:** View and manage incoming/past orders.
    *   **Active Kiosk Sessions:** Monitor current customer activity.
    *   **Kiosk Sales Reports:** Analyze sales data.
    *   **Product Options Management:** Create reusable options (sizes, toppings).

    `[Image: Store Owner - Step 2 - Screenshot of the Kiosk Configuration Dashboard overview]`

### 3. Setting Up Your Kiosk Menu
*   **Register Products:** Ensure all your products are accurately entered into the system. Use the "Add New Product" or "Edit Product" functions as needed.
*   **Design the Display:**
    *   Typically, you'll see two areas: "Available Store Products" and your "Kiosk Menu Layout."
    *   Drag products from your available list to the kiosk menu.
    *   To change the order, drag and drop products and category dividers within the "Kiosk Menu Layout."
    *   Add "Category Dividers" (e.g., "Appetizers," "Main Courses") to organize your menu, name them, and position them.

### 4. Managing Product Availability and Details
*   For any product on your kiosk menu:
    *   Quickly toggle a "Sold Out" status if an item is unavailable.
    *   Click to edit product details (name, price, image) and assign or customize product-specific options (e.g., linking to global options or creating unique ones for that item).

    `[Image: Store Owner - Step 4 - Screenshot of toggling 'Sold Out' status and accessing product edit options from the Kiosk Menu Layout]`

### 5. Creating Reusable Product Options (Global Option Editor)
*   Navigate to the "Global Product Options" or a similarly named editor.
*   Create option groups (e.g., "Drink Size," "Extra Toppings").
*   Within each group, define choices with names and any price adjustments (e.g., "Large" for +$1.00, "Extra Cheese" for +$0.75).
*   These global options can then be quickly applied to multiple products when you edit them.

### 6. Saving and Publishing Your Kiosk Menu
*   After making any changes to your products, menu layout, or options, ensure you click the "Save Kiosk Configuration" or "Publish to Kiosks" button. This makes your updates live for customers.

    `[Image: Store Owner - Step 6 - Screenshot highlighting the 'Save' or 'Publish' button]`

### 7. Monitoring Kiosk Operations
*   Regularly check your Kiosk Management dashboard to:
    *   **Manage Orders:** View incoming orders, update their status (e.g., "Preparing," "Ready for Pickup").
    *   **View Active Sessions:** See how many customers are currently using the kiosk.
    *   **Review Sales Reports:** Track performance and gather insights from kiosk sales.
